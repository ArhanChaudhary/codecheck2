#!/bin/bash

# This program expects that a user "comrunner" exists. It receives
# as argument a zip file with a file "script" in the root, a directory
# "in" with inputs and other directories with source and auxiliary files.
# The "script" file may contain the following directives:
# prepare targetDir sourceDir sourceDir ...
#   The target directory is created, and all source directories are
#   copied into it, in the order given
# compile dir language sourcefiles
#   All source files are compiled in the given directory.
#   language is Java, Cpp, Python, etc.--see preload.sh
#   Compiler messages are placed in out/dir/_compile (if compilation
#   succeeded) or in out/dir/_errors if not
# run dir id timeout interleaveio language module arg1 arg2 ...
#   Runs the application with the given "module" (main file without
#   extension) and command line arguments in the given directory.
#   Program stdout/stderr is saved in out/id/_run. timeout is the
#   timeout in seconds. interleaveio is true if input/output should
#   be interleaved with the interleaveio.py script, false otherwise.
# unittest dir timeout lang mainsource source2 source3 ...
#   Runs a unit test for the given language, with output in out/dir/_run
# process dir command args
#   Executes the given command in the given directory, with the given
#   arguments. Currently, only the "CheckStyle" command is supported.
# collect dir file1 file2 ...
#   Collects the files from the given directory in out/dir.
#
# When the script completes, it zips up the contents of the
# out directory and prints its location.
#
# This program is invoked from the trivial server.js application
# which receives a zip file with the script, sources, and auxiliary
# files and returns a zip with the outputs.
