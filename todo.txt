If interleaveio is inherently unstable, may need to run without, compare result, and then run with for visual representation

for f in `seq 1 100` ; do http POST http://codecheck.it/checkNJS  @/data/temp/request.json | jq '. | {score}' ; done

CodeCheck requires that a tester ends in "Tester", "Tester2", etc. I suppose I could change CodeCheck to allow "_tester" as well.

I added another output to cc-6, but there is no easy way to do it with cc-7. //OUTPUT doesn't interact well with //SUB or //CALL.

Unify substitutions with running? It's no different, except for
that table. (Which we could generally adopt, and maybe have.)

Hi Rance,

unfortunately, CALL doesn't work with the TOLERANCE, IGNORECASE, and IGNORESPACE pseudocomments. This would be a nice change going forward, but I don't know how to implement it in Python. I would need to write a Python function 

deepEqual(x, y, tolerance, ignorecase, ignorespace) 

that checks whether x and y are equal except if they are doubles, use the tolerance, if they are strings, use ignorecase/ignorespace (I know how to do this part), and if they are sequences such as lists, sets, or tuples, do this recursively for the elements. I guess I should see if something is iterable (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952464/in-python-how-do-i-determine-if-an-object-is-iterable). This seems like a good thing to do in the long run, and I am adding it to the wish list.---

Another "to be fixed eventually" problem

When using the picture class, if the image is not found and exception is thrown but then the student gets a pass and full marks. 

Here is the report.

http://www.codecheck.it/fetch/17072919018705920314428255902/report.html

This happened because I forgot to include the image, but the same thing would happen if the student misspelled the file name

Can we compare numbers by significant digits rather than by epsilon?

score and maxscore in new JSON instead of score/maxscore?

http -j POST cs20.cs.sjsu.edu:8080/checkJson < /data/temp/test.json



We need a bunch of permissions for Jackson and could put that
into /opt/codecheck/lib/jackson and add it to the classpath.

JUnit only needs

  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers";

and we grant that to students and testers so they can do stuff with reflection

This reorg would deal with an attack where a student puts arbitrary code into a JUnit test file.

It would be nice if when the Javadoc is correct, Checkstyle printed something other than pass - perhaps just the "OK"? or "style pass"?

Ron codecheck bug Sun, 21 Jun 2015 23:55:32 System.exit in solution

Codecheck--when one compares program output, and the student has an additional \n at the end, Codecheck fails in a hard-to-understand way.
- Can one accept blank lines at the end when the solution has none?

Remedy 1: Check that the method returned without an exception, and don't give any points otherwise.

Remedy 2: Instead of doing the Expected thing, just compare with the outcome from the expected run

public class TrafficLight
{
    // instance variable
    private int value;

    public void next()
    {
        // code for next method
        TrafficLight light1 = new TrafficLight();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 2");
    }

    public int getReds()
    {
        
        return 0 + 1; // Fix this statement
    }
}

public class TrafficLightTester
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        TrafficLight light1 = new TrafficLight();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 2");
    }
}

Thanks, I figured out the problem. It doesn't make sense to show the binary file encrypted.txt to the student, and it can't be read in as a text file because it's invalid UTF-8. But I changed the mechanism for hiding files, and I'll have to refine that. I'll put it on my todo list.


------------------------------------------------------------------



It depends, unfortunately. They won't get 4/6, but they might get 4 (without a denominator) if code-check can't figure out what the total was because it died prematurely.

It would be a good idea to have it figure out the total, perhaps by grading the solution. I'll add that to the wish list.

Is SUB useful???

;;MAIN


Can have

#lang racket
(provide (all-defined-out))

as first two lines and then use

(require "file.rkt")

or neither of the two and then

(include "file.rkt")


Problem with main

Don't want main for regular work, but then how to recognize main file?
Need main for CALL to feed arg 1 2 3 etc.
Don't want main for test-engine/racket-tests
