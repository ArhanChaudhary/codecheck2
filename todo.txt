Shorten timeout, user selectable

Limit stdout size, user selectable

Add stdin to stdout

When looking for the main class, it currently looks for the string 

public static void main(String[] args)

It will miss

public static void main (String[] args)

Instead, compile the solution and use reflection.

The issue I am currently running into with the system:
> I am providing a check.properties file, with 4 different args settings:
> test1.args-inputFile1.txt
> test2.args-too many arguments
> test3.args-
> test4.args-thisFileNameIsMissingSoItCannotBeFound.txt

That's a reasonable expectation. But to make it true, you need to add 

test1.in-
test2.in-
test3.in-
test4.in-

to check.properties or supply four blank files test1.in ... test4.in. Right now, it doesn't look at testn.args if there isn't a testn.in or testn.out.
