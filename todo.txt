Course

For reusing assignments in coming semester, need notion of course. null course if none given.

Course has assignments

Name     Deadline     URL   [View submissions]  [Delete]


Trash [Empty]

Name     Deadline     URL   [View submissions]  [Undelete]


Existing assignments are cloned into course
New assignments have same edit key as course (course owner owns assignments)

Can download all submissions in course

Can clone entire course

Concept 2: Course is simply a tag

&tag=... for submissions, filter by tag

* horstmann_codecheck might as well get the file data if they don't currently exist. Just do this in JavaScript:
               String fileData = new String(url.openStream().readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
               String replacement = "<div class='horstmann_codecheck'><script type='text/javascript'>//<![CDATA[\n" +

                  fileData.substring(1) +
                  ")\n// ]]>\n</script></div>\n";



* horstmann_vitalsource (which is part of horstmann_all_min) defines

* Use client UI for interactivities.ws/makews script; in general, try to use client UI

* You are right about the vertical lines. They shouldn't appear when the solved problem is restored. I fixed that in my code, 

* With MC, hide answer at outset

* Long-term want proof that students have the book. Make them solve a trivial problem and store unlock code as the problem state

* Example table enhancement if the solution has \n, provide a text area. Make it possible to not have Start button. If no entries in third column, show the first two at 50%.

Docker

Think of queue implementation once we have Docker


Dockerfile
JDK 8 image
Make second layer with our stuff
Third layer???

Now with a server

Server must get problem zip (because we don't want any security inside, do that in Play), student JSON (all file content), and input (in run mode)

Like checkNJS but with the zip base64-encoded (for now)

Returning completableFuture
http://heidloff.net/article/developing-reactive-rest-apis-with-quarkus/

Seems the best entrypoint to Quarkus because there is no UI involved



For now, gave up on checker-only Docker. Docker contains Play server.

Hi Rance,

unfortunately, CALL doesn't work with the TOLERANCE, IGNORECASE, and IGNORESPACE pseudocomments. This would be a nice change going forward, but I don't know how to implement it in Python. I would need to write a Python function 

deepEqual(x, y, tolerance, ignorecase, ignorespace) 

that checks whether x and y are equal except if they are doubles, use the tolerance, if they are strings, use ignorecase/ignorespace (I know how to do this part), and if they are sequences such as lists, sets, or tuples, do this recursively for the elements. I guess I should see if something is iterable (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952464/in-python-how-do-i-determine-if-an-object-is-iterable). This seems like a good thing to do in the long run, and I am adding it to the wish list.---

Another "to be fixed eventually" problem

When using the picture class, if the image is not found and exception is thrown but then the student gets a pass and full marks. 

Here is the report.

http://www.codecheck.it/fetch/17072919018705920314428255902/report.html

This happened because I forgot to include the image, but the same thing would happen if the student misspelled the file name

We need a bunch of permissions for Jackson and could put that
into /opt/codecheck/lib/jackson and add it to the classpath.

JUnit only needs

  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessDeclaredMembers";

and we grant that to students and testers so they can do stuff with reflection

This reorg would deal with an attack where a student puts arbitrary code into a JUnit test file.

Remedy 1: Check that the method returned without an exception, and don't give any points otherwise.

Remedy 2: Instead of doing the Expected thing, just compare with the outcome from the expected run

public class TrafficLight
{
    // instance variable
    private int value;

    public void next()
    {
        // code for next method
        TrafficLight light1 = new TrafficLight();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 2");
    }

    public int getReds()
    {
        
        return 0 + 1; // Fix this statement
    }
}

public class TrafficLightTester
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        TrafficLight light1 = new TrafficLight();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());
        System.out.println("Expected: 1");
        light1.next();
        System.out.println(light1.getReds());

Thanks, I figured out the problem. It doesn't make sense to show the binary file encrypted.txt to the student, and it can't be read in as a text file because it's invalid UTF-8. But I changed the mechanism for hiding files, and I'll have to refine that. I'll put it on my todo list.


------------------------------------------------------------------



It depends, unfortunately. They won't get 4/6, but they might get 4 (without a denominator) if code-check can't figure out what the total was because it died prematurely.

It would be a good idea to have it figure out the total, perhaps by grading the solution. I'll add that to the wish list.

Testers with RackUnit

Unit testing:
http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/api.html#%28part._.Overview_of_.Rack.Unit%29

Is SUB useful???

;;MAIN


Can have

#lang racket
(provide (all-defined-out))

as first two lines and then use

(require "file.rkt")

or neither of the two and then

(include "file.rkt")


Problem with main

Don't want main for regular work, but then how to recognize main file?
Need main for CALL to feed arg 1 2 3 etc.
Don't want main for test-engine/racket-tests
